### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**marisa-loccarini/marisa-loccarini** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning database systems, information systems, and client-side scripting. I am in my second semester of computer science so I am very much a beginner in this field. I am enjoying coding so far and I'm excited to broaden my knowledge with github.
